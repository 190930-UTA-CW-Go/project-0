Self Critique
What did we do well?

+++

    @fapaw We did not know how to use things like React and Flask but we learned quickly

+++

    @fapaw We were willing to dig through documentation and understand how all the libraries we were using worked

+++

    @fapaw We were not afraid to communicate about stories that we were falling behind on

+++

    @fapaw We shared code equally and made changes to each otherâ€™s work to improve quality

What did we learn?

+++

    @fapaw How to create a visualization with D3.js +++

    @fapaw Set up a postgres database +++

    @fapaw How to deal with merge conflicts and conflicts in general

What can we do better?

+++

    @fapaw If a library exists, learn it and use it.

+++

    @fapaw Write tests first instead of the end, especially if you don't know how the testing libraries work

What puzzles us?

+++

    @fapaw We occasionally get a random 500 error in our development environments

What did they do well?

+++

    @fapaw Good for health conscious users

+++

    @fapaw Nice overall aesthetics

+++

    @fapaw They have breadcrumb feature which is unique and innovative

+++

    @fapaw They have great error handling and clearly thought about their users

What did we learn from their website?

+++

    @fapaw Error handling

+++

    @fapaw Their usage of Travis showed us how to use continuous integration on a large project

+++

    @fapaw We learned that met stands for metabolic equivalent, a measure of energy cost of physical activities

What can they do better?

+++

    @fapaw They can expose the relationship between models via the API
    @fapaw Difficult to make insights using API

Note: Simply returns data about that specific instance Customers cannot get information that is exposed on the website via the API

+++

    @fapaw They can separate pagination of the models on the search page
    @fapaw Disrupts flow of navigation

Note: Page position is lost while naviating
What puzzles us about their website?

+++

    @fapaw Many of the model suggestions seem random
    @fapaw Results unexpectedly change upon refreshing the page

Note: Suggestions are less meaningful

+++

    @fapaw It doesn't seem like they are utilizing their own API

Note: Functionality is often missing from the API because they aren't using it Changes require reloading the page, as data is sent with HTML
