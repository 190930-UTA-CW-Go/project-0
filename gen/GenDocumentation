FUNCTIONS

func Generate(rows int, columns int, max int) ([]string, []string, []int)
    Generate is the main function inside the gen package. Really, Generate
    should be the only function in the gen package to be called outside of the
    gen and the gen_test package. Additionally, it should only be called once,
    at the start of main.go inside the main package.

func MakeIndex(rows int, columns int) []string
    MakeIndex generates an index key for the database. The key is a letter
    followed by a number (such as A3). A vending machine can have multiple rows
    (denoted by the letter) and multiple columns (denoted by the number).
    main.go in the main package specifies how many rows and columns the vending
    machine will have. The index will always start at "A1."

    func ToCharStr(i int) string
        ToCharStr increments the letter for each new row.

func MakeBeverage(rows int, columns int) []string
    MakeBeverage generates a slice that wil tell the database which type of
    drink goes where.

func MakeStock(rows int, columns int, max int) []int
    MakeStock generates a slice that wil tell the database how many of each
    drink is in the row. It does by creating a random integer between 0 and a
    maximum specified by main.go in the main package.
